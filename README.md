# Personal Portfolio

![Banner (Decorative)](./doc/ppw-banner.png)

## Overview

This is a personal portfolio website built with Vue.js with TypeScript (transitioned from
Angular, React, and Vanilla JavaScript). This allow me to showcase my projects in one
central place and also learn web development. **This website is still under**
**construction.**

## Running Locally

Running the website locally is as simple as a few commands after cloning the git
repository. There are no external measures to be setup.

```sh
# Install dependancies.
npm install
# Run local server.
npm run dev
```
