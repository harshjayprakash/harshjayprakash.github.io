# Personal Portfolio Website

## Overview

This is a personal portfolio website build with Vue.js and TypeScript (Transitioned from 
Angular, from React, and from Vanialla JavaScript). This allows me to showcase my projects 
in one central place and also learn web development. **Please note that this website**
**is still under construction**

## Running Locally

Running the website locally is simple as a few commands after cloning the git respository.
There are no external measures to be setup (except from Node.JS).

```pwsh
# Install Dependencies
npm install
# Run the local server
npm run dev
```

## Known Issues and Limitations

* Not Finished. Still in Active Development.
