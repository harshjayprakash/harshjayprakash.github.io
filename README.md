# Personal Portfolio Website

This is a personal portfolio website built with Vue.js and TypeScript. This allows me to
showcase my projects in one central place. **This website is still under construction**.

## Running Locally

Running the website locally is simple as a few commands after cloning the git repository.
There are no external measures to be setup.

```sh
# Install dependencies.
npm install
# Run local server.
npm run dev
```
